## How do I report a bug or suggest a feature?
Feel free to open an issue with your bug report or feature request, with as many details as possible. If you'd like to write a feature, please open an issue first for discussion. For help with the bot, please see the wiki (linked above).


## Can I self-host Vortex?
I wouldn't recommend it. Self-hosting this bot (running a copy yourself) is not supported, and no help will be provided for editing nor compiling the code in this repository. The source code is provided here for transparency about how the bot's primary features work. If you decide to edit, compile, or use this code in any way, please respect the [license](https://github.com/jagrosh/Vortex/blob/master/LICENSE)
